# HiBy OS Crack
Cracking the firmware of HiBy's linux devices

This project is part of the hiby-modding organization. Also see:
- [hiby-r3proii-custom-firmware](https://github.com/hiby-modding/hiby-r3proii-custom-firmware) by noisetta — complementary firmware modding project that adds Arabic text rendering support and documents the proprietary OTA firmware format.

## Scope
- For now, this project focuses on the HiBy R3 Pro II, as it's the only one I have. As far as I know, there are some minor differences between the firmwares on the different HiBy linux devices, but most things apply universally.
- The goal of this project is to make it possible to modify the HiBy OS firmware to add custom functionality.
- For now, this project also only focuses on the HiBy OS firmware used by the generation including the R1, R3, and R3 Pro II
    - Older devices such as the R3 Pro and the R3 Pro Saber used a different format. see [hiby-firmware-tools](https://github.com/SuperTaiyaki/hiby-firmware-tools) by SuperTaiyaki on GitHub for that older type of firmware

### Note for Windows
For equivalent functionality on Windows, please see `docs/WIN_INSTALL.md`.

## Workflow
**For HiBy R3 Pro II**
1. go to `r3proii/unpacking_and_repacking`
2. run `unpack.sh` (it will ask for sudo permissions for part of the script). this will create a gitignored folder called `squashfs-root`.
3. modify the contents of `squashfs-root` to make whatever custom firmware you want
4. run `repack.sh` (it will ask for sudo permissions for part of the script). this will create a gitignored file called `r3proii.upt`
5. flash that firmware file onto the device (how to do that is explained below)

**Workflow Notes**
- `squashfs-root` represents the root filesystem that will be flashed with the firmware.
- most/all of the files in `squashfs-root` will be owned by `root`, so it can be annoying to modify sometimes. This is also why it's gitignored
- `r3proii.upt` is the firmware file


## Notes
- (TODO, make sure the following is correct) The HiBy OS filesystem is read-only, since it's a squashfs image. Only mounted storage, like `sd_0` can be written to.
