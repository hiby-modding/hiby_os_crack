# HiBy OS Crack
Cracking the firmware of HiBy's linux devices

> [!TIP]
> If you just want to see instructions on how to install custom firmware onto your device: [here's the guide](/guides/INSTALLING_FIRMWARE))

---

This repo is for:
- Tools to unpack/repack hiby os firmwares
- Documentation on the structure of the firmware
- Documentation on the device (datasheets, ISA, etc.)
- Other tools and information helpful for creating custom firmwares

## Scope
- The goal of this project is to make it possible to modify the HiBy OS firmware to add custom functionality.
- For now, this project also only focuses on the HiBy OS firmware used by the generation including the R1, R3 II 2025, R3 Pro II, and Tempotec V1. These devices all use the `.upt` firmware format and have an Ingenic X1600E CPU.
    - Older devices such as the R3 Pro and the R3 Pro Saber used a different format. see [hiby-firmware-tools](https://github.com/SuperTaiyaki/hiby-firmware-tools) by SuperTaiyaki on GitHub for that older type of firmware

### Note for Windows
For equivalent functionality on Windows, please see [docs/WIN_INSTALL.md](/docs/WIN_INSTALL.md).

## Supported Devices
This repo is applicable to any HiBy OS device that uses the `.upt` firmware type. However, each device has it's own stock firmware and slightly different hardware.

We have collected documentation and created firmware unpacking/repacking scripts for the following devices:
- HiBy R1
- HiBy R3Pro II

## Guides
- [installing firmware](/guides/INSTALLING_FIRMWARE.md)
- [firmware unpacking](/guides/UNPACKING.md)
- [firmware repacking](/guides/REPACKING.md)
- [accessing ADB](/guides/ACCESSING_ADB.md)
- [easter egg](/guides/EASTER_EGG.md)

## Tools
- [general upt firmware unpacking script (no helper)](/scripts/unpack.sh)
    - Can unpack any `.upt` firmware
- [general upt firmware repacking script (no helper)](/scripts/repack.sh)
    - Can repack any unpacked `.upt` firmware
- Unpacking and repacking helper scripts. Called `unpack-helper.sh` and `repack-helper.sh` exist in the `unpacking_and_repacking` directory for the relevant device.
    - Base firmwares are already provided
    - No configuring needed, just run the script and select what you want
    - This helper (automatic) script has only been written for devices that we've collected documentation and firmware for already, so we don't have it for every supported device yet. Feel free to contribute those for new devices.

## Unpacking and Repacking Workflow Overview
> [!TIP]
> For more specific and detailed instructions, look at [UNPACKING.md](/guides/UNPACKING.md) and [REPACKING.md](/guides/REPACKING.md).
1. Depending on your device, enter either the `r1` directory or the `r3proii` directory
2. if you want to unpack a firmware not in this repo already, add it in the `firmware/custom` directory
3. enter the `unpacking_and_repacking` directory for your device
4. to unpack your firmware use the `unpack-helper.sh` script and choose the firmware you want to unpack
    - The linux root filesystem of the firmware will be extracted into a folder
5. to repack your firmware, just run the `repack-helper.sh` script

> [!NOTE]
> - You might need to create the `firmware/custom` directory if it doesn't exist
> - I've made it so that the unpacking and repacking scripts no longer need sudo in order to run
